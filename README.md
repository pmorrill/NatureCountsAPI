# NatureCountsAPI
The NatureCounts API provides entry points for the NatureCounts R-client application. It is not designed to be used in any other fashion.

Entrypoints come in two flavours: those delivering metadata such as lists of filtering options, and those delivering data as summaries or raw sets.
